##Next Steps:
* Add in Google Maps API to link locations to their GPS, and images.
* As a User, I want to be able to sort the Vacation Spots by their Name, Location, Review Count, and Average Review Score.
* As a User, I want a Search Form that narrows down the index page list. This form would then redirect back to the Index page, keeping only the spots relevant to the sort.
* As a Signed in User, I want to be able to sort my comments by Time Posted, Spot Name, Review Score, and Review Content Length.
